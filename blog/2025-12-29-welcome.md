## What is PHP Compatible?

PHP Compatible is a collection of packages that bring modern PHP features to legacy PHP versions. Our mission is to help developers who are stuck on older PHP versions still benefit from modern language features and patterns. So that they can migrate to the latest version of PHP.

## Our Packages

- **Router** - A flexible routing library with support for file-based, functional, and modern routing approaches
- **Enum** - PHP 8-style enums for PHP 7.x
- **Templates** - A secure PHP templating engine

Stay tuned for more updates!
